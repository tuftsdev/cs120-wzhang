        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I have been hired as a security consultant to document and 
            resolve the security and privacy issues of a ride-hailing service.
            This includes finding any potential security issues that exist within the
            ride-hailing service.</p>

        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p>Methodology used in this lab includes 
            <li>Review the source code of the project. </li> 
            <li>Using Burp Suite to check any potential security issues with the project.</li>
            <li>Using sample user input to test potential sql injection.</li>
        </p>

        <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
        <p>There are several places that user can input some SQL languages
            to either dump garbage data to the database or pull unexpected data that is
            not suppose to be avaliable to the users. Also, hackers can use other tools to 
            send dummy request to attack the server.
        </p>

        <h1>Issues Found</h1>
        <p>
            <li>Insert data sql injection</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Issue: User can modify their lng value to duump garbage data into the database</li>
                    <li>Location: Line 53 in server-vuln.js</li>
                    <li>Severity of issue: High</li>
                    <li>Description of issue: User can use other tools to modify their request data sent to the server especially
                        the value of lng which may have another insert into statment to dump garbage data into the database.
                    </li>
                    <li>Proof of vulnerability: If the value of lng is something like 455.214)'; Insert into vehicles(username, lat, lng) VALUES (...)  
                        where ... can be lot of garbage data. This would occupy a big amount of memory of the database.
                    </li>
                    <li>Resolution: we should implement some validation before insert any data into the database.
                        For example: is there any single quote in the input? any SQL key words used?
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>SQL select statement database injection</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Issue: When the username is in certain format then all the data 
                        from both passenger and vehicle table will be pulled.</li>
                    <li>Location: Line 72 and 87 in server-vuln.js</li>
                    <li>Severity of issue: High</li>
                    <li>Description of issue: When the input username from user combines some specific conditions that overwrites
                        the first condition in the select statment, then all the data from the database could be pulled and show to
                        the user which is a terrible situation with data leaks.
                    </li>
                    <li>Proof of vulnerability: If the value of the user name is something like "JANET"' or 1=1'. Then the second 
                        condition overwrites the previous match statement and all the data in the table will be qulified to be shown 
                        to the user.
                    </li>
                    <li>Resolution: we should implement some validation before insert any data into the database.
                        For example: is there any single quote in the input? any SQL key words used?
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>Hard coded vehicle name</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Issue: Vehicle name is hard coded in the source code without any encryption.</li>
                    <li>Location: Line 45 in server-vuln.js</li>
                    <li>Severity of issue: medium</li>
                    <li>Description of issue: All the vehicle name data is hardcoded and shown in the source code
                        code without any encryption which is not a good practice.
                    </li>
                    <li>Proof of vulnerability: We may have new vehicle names or want to update some vehicle names that will 
                        become very manual work.
                    </li>
                    <li>Resolution: store the vehicle names in a separate file and encryted without direct access to the other users.

                    </li>
                </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Sql injection is a big problem and may consider a consisten solution to aviod using simple insert or 
            select statment without any validation of the input. And try to avoid any hard coded information like 
            vehicle name, conneciton configuration data etc, try to put them in separate files and use third party 
            software like jenkins to populate those parameters safely.
